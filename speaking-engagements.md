![Speaking at NDC Oslo 2016](/img/ndcoslo-closeup.jpg)

Every opportunity I get to share my knowledge and experience with others is a blessing! I'm just getting started with speaking publicly about what I've learned in the realm of frontend engineering and have thoroughly enjoyed it thus far. I look forward to where this journey will take me.

I am open to speak about anything I write about in [my blog](http://www.benmvp.com). I also have plenty of experience not currently expressed in a blog post. If you're interested in having me speak to or hold a workshop with your group, thank you! That means a lot that you find me worthy enough to share with your group. Please feel free to contact me via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/benmvp) or [email](mailto:ben@benmvp.com).

You can also check out my [Lanyrd profile](http://lanyrd.com/profile/benmvp/) for more information.

## 2016

### [Front Porch Conference](http://frontporch.io/austin/)

##### Austin, Texas

#### [React + ES.next = ♥](http://frontporch.io/ben-ilegbodu)

Friday, July 19, 2016 at Alamo Theater

> JavaScript is evolving quickly. The ES6 specification was released in 2015 and is quickly being implemented by modern browsers. New versions of ECMAScript will now be released on a yearly basis. We can leverage ES6 and functionality slated for future versions right now to write even clearer and more concise React code.

> Experience with React will help you get the most out of this session, but you don’t have to have a JavaScript black belt to leave feeling confident in using ES6 with React. Learn how to write cleaner code using the new spread operator, classes, modules, destructuring, and other tasty syntactic sugar features being introduced into ECMAScript. Oh, and don’t worry if you don’t understand all of those terms — you soon will after this session!

### [NDC Oslo 2016](http://ndcoslo.com/)

##### Oslo, Norway

#### [You don't need JavaScript for that!](http://ndcoslo.com/talk/you-dont-need-javascript-for-that/)

Friday, June 10, 2016 @ 1:40p in Room 7   
🎞 [Slides](http://www.benmvp.com/slides/2016/ndcoslo/no-js.html) | 🖥 [Code examples](/you-dont-need-js-for-that)

> We have been using JavaScript toolkits like jQuery for nearly a decade to make manipulating the DOM easier as we create our highly-interactive web apps. New features in HTML5 & CSS3 should’ve made old development strategies obsolete, and yet we’re still using jQuery to do things better suited for HTML5 & CSS3. Why? Well, old habits die hard.

> In this session, let’s look at ways we used to build interactivity in JavaScript and see how we can transform them into more optimal solutions using plain old HTML and CSS. We’ll discuss CSS3 transitions & animations, new HTML5 attributes, and other “tricks” to offload JavaScript functionality to the browser’s rendering engine for more performant web applications. Whether you’re a seasoned JavaScripter or just getting started, you’ll leave the session with fresh ideas to work with.

> Features from ECMAScript 6 have been in browsers since early 2012. We’ve seen ES6 syntax used in talks for compact code, but can it really be used right now for cross-browser compatible production code? Let’s uncover a broad range of new features, like arrow functions, rest parameters, and generators, that will have you itching to start developing your favorite app in ES6.

🎞 [Slides](http://www.benmvp.com/slides/2016/devweek/es6.html) | 🖥 [Code examples](https://github.com/benmvp/learning-es6)

> ECMAScript 6 is the new version of JavaScript making its way into the engines of our modern browsers and servers. Some of its features appear to be no more than a little syntax _sugar_ — making development we already do in JavaScript a bit easier. Others add brand new functionality long missing in JavaScript, which allow us to _spice_ up our code without having to include yet another library.

> Experience with JavaScript will help you get the most out of this session, but you don’t have to be a JS ninja to leave confident to begin using ES6 right now. Let’s walk through all the _sugar_ and _spice_ of ES6 and what makes it just so nice for code readability. Along the way, you’ll learn about arrow functions, destructuring, rest parameters, and other features. We’ll also see strategies for how we can circumvent that pesky issue of cross-browser compatibility. Oh, and don’t worry if you didn’t understand any of those terms — you will after the session.
