Keep learning my friends. ðŸ¤“

- typically we want to mock only one (or two) functions and leave the rest as normal
- but what if we want the inverse?

```js
jest.mock('../path/to/module', () => {
  const actual = jest.requireActual('../path/to/module')

  const allMocked = jest.createMockFromModule('../path/to/module')

  return {
    __esModules: true,
    ...allMocked,
    unMockedFunc: actual.unMockedFunc,
  }
})
```
