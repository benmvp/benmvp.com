Keep learning my friends. ðŸ¤“

- How & why to extract
  - If the logic is complex/large enough I'll extract to a single-use function
  - IMO makes it easier to reason about the logic and the component separately
- Examples
  - Getting API data
  - Accessing `localStorage`
  - Event handler on the `window` or `document`
