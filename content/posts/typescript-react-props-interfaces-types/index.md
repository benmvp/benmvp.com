- More or less the same
  - 95% of the time they are interchangeable for the simple cases
  - TS says to use `interface` by default so that's what I do
- Both can define an object
- Both can extend
- Both can use generics
- Complex prop relationships will use types
  - discriminated unions
  - See other posts
- There is one little difference for each
  - interfaces cannot extend union types
  - type intersection name collisions cause problems
    - Use interface
    - Use `Omit<>`

Keep learning my friends. ðŸ¤“
