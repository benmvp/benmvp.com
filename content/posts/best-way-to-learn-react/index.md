- Been developing in React 4.5 years, speaking & teach
- I get asked a lot on where to learn React
  - Got a team wanting to learn React best practices
- When I was learning, the only thing available was official React tutorial
  - That's how I like to learn
  - I get physical books when learning a new language
- Options
  - Written tutorials: official tutorial
    - go at my own pace
    - "see code"
  - Live workshops: React training, Kent, minishops
    - other paced
    - ask questions
  - Video tutorials: Kent's egghead course
    - in between
    - self-paced
    - visual
- Applies outside of React too
  - Could be alienating by providing only one way

Keep learning my friends. ðŸ¤“
