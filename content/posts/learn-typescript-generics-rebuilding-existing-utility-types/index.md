Keep learning my friends. ðŸ¤“

- A lot of times when we get started with generics we use them directly in functions
  - See previous posts
- They can also be used to create reusable types like the built in utility types
  - Generics are like implicit return functions but for types
  - https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/utility-types.html
- I learn best by seeing real-world examples
  - See something new in the context of something familiar helps me make the connection
- Rebuilding TS utility types you may have used
  - `Array<T>`
  - `Omit<>`
- Conditional types: https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/conditional-types.html#inferring-within-conditional-types
