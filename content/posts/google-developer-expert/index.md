I woke up this morning to some wonderful news! I'm now a part of the Google Developer Experts Program in **Web Technologies**! 🎉

I already received my first [Microsoft MVP Award](/blog/microsoft-mvp/) late last year and now I'm a GDE. It's so exciting and humbling. I really do appreciate being recognized for both my technical abilities as well as my contribution to the community with all my [talks and workshops](/speak/), especially since I do React and not Angular. I really do enjoy teaching others and helping folks level up their skills.

The evaluation process wasn't too bad really. The hardest part is getting past qualifying stage that happens after submitting the application. It's kind of a black box. But once I passed the eligibility criteria for being a technical expert and displaying continued speaking activity, the rest of the evaluation process went smoothly. I had an interview with another GDE then a Googler and I was in! Actually, the hardest part might have been actually applying. Because in order to even get an application you have to be referred by a Googler or current GDE.

Anyway, I'm looking forward to what all being a part of the program offers. To start, check out this awesome animation they included in the email!
