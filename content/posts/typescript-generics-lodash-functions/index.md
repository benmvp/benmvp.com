Keep learning my friends. ðŸ¤“

- Generics are super powerful but also pretty complicated
  - Generics are like implicit return functions but for types
  - Blog post on generics for folks who gave up learning generics
- I learn best by seeing real-world examples
  - See something new in the context of something familiar helps me make the connection
- Types for familiar functions
  - `identity()`
  - `first()`
  - `forEach()`
  - `map()`
  - `reduce()`
  - `zip()`
