title: New Blog!
category: general

Welcome to my newly resurrected blog! The old version of the blog hadn't been touched since late 2011 and focused on my personal life. This new iteration of the blog should focus primarily on my professional life as a Senior Software Engineer. Right now my concentration is on Web Front-End, but I find all sorts of UIs appealing, so I'm in the early stages of getting into Mobile Application development as well.

I want to use this blog to share out technical topics that I find interesting and would like to discuss more deeply than what can be said in a 140-character [tweet](https://twitter.com/benmvp). I plan to share code I've worked on and highlight technical problems that I've solved at work or on the side. I also intend for some blog posts to serve as written versions of talks that I hope to begin giving in the not-so-distant future.

If all goes well this blog can serve as a resource for those solving every day problems in the realm of web development and hopefully mobile app development as well.

Enjoy!
