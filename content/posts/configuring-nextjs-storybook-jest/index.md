Keep learning my friends. ðŸ¤“

- Next is powerful on its own
  - Comes w/ lots of batteries
  - But we don't use it by itself
- Use it alongside Storybook & Jest
  - They also need to be similarly configured to work w/ the same source code
  - They each come w/ their default setup + support
- Features
  - SCSS modules
  - Importing SVGs
