- 3 criteria for a software engineer
  - Results
  - Behavior (it's not about not being a erk)
  - Sphere of impact
- Senior engineer
  - Impacts the team, starts reaching outside
  - Behavior: corrective reviews, informal teaching, mentorship
  - Results: quick results, big results, correct results
    - Figures out the correct abstractions faster
    - Debugs faster

Keep learning my friends. ðŸ¤“
