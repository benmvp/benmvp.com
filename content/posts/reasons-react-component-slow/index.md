- React is _fast_ because of reconciliation
  - so usually optimizing isn't necessary
  - but only so much it can do
  - so if our apps are slow, it's likely cause we're making it work more than needed
- huge components
- passing object/array literals as props
- anonymous function props
- missing useEffect deps
- object useEffect deps
- array useEffect deps
- storing state in DOM
- rendering too much DOM
- expensive `useState` initialize (see other post)

Keep learning my friends. ðŸ¤“
