Last month on October 16th I had the opportunity to give my first technical talk in a public setting at the [Little Rock Tech Fest 2015](http://lrtechfest.com/). My talk was entitled _Sugar & Spice and Everything nice about ES6_ and it was based on the [_Learning ES6 series_](/learning-es6-series/).

I think the talk went well. The audience overall wasn't particularly JavaScript savvy so it was a challenge to explain improvements to JavaScript with ES6 when folks were unfamiliar with ES3/ES5. There were a handful of knowledgeable folks that got something out of it, however. But it ended up being a blessing because I got great practice and it was a positive learning experience. I learned two main things from the talk:

First, as much as I want to, I cannot explain the whole world. Even though I had 50 minutes (which feels like a long time) there are 30+ features added to ES6 so there was no way I could even adequately explain half of them. I think I ended up trying to explain half of the features and it was just way too much. Way too much for me and way to much for the audience.

Second, I realized that when I am explaining how a piece of technology works, the _why_ is just as important (if not more important) than the _how_. I can explain _how_ destructuring works to the cows come home, but if I don't properly explain _why_ we as JavaScript developers should use it, most people won't feel any sense of motivation to learn.

I just gave a shorter 30-minute version of the talk at Nodevember 2015 where I did focus on the _why_ as well as narrowing the scope of the talk. As a result, it went a whole lot better (for me and the attendees). If you're looking to learn more about ECMAScript 6, I would suggest watching that video instead. However, if you want to see the Little Rock Tech Fest video, here you go!

Hopefully this will be the first of many, many more to come!
