React is a JavaScript UI library that makes creating reusable components easy and efficient. It’s critical to understand the fundamentals of creating custom configurable components, fetching and maintaining state, and rendering UI based upon that state and component configurations.

## Get ready to...

- Write configurable, reusable and composable components
- Use JSX syntax
- Work with the “Virtual DOM”
- Handle user interactions and synthetic events
- Maintain application state
- Make API calls
- Apply component styling
- And more tidbits and nuances of quality React development…

## You’ll need to have...

- No prior experience with React needed
- Experience building web user interfaces with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript DOM APIs
- Experience with modern JavaScript syntax and asynchronous patterns like `Promise` & `async`/`await`

## This may not be for you if...

- You already have experience developing in React with class components (consider the [React Component Classes to Hooks]() minishop instead)
- You already have dabbled with hooks in React (consider the [TypeScript for React Developers]() minishop instead)

## What is a "minishop"?

This minishop is highly-focused and fully-remote, 3-hour workshop that allows you to learn the concepts quickly and get on with the rest of your day. To learn more about minishops, read the [Introducing Minishops]() blog post.
