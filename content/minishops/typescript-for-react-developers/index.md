TypeScript is a JavaScript superset that compiles down to vanilla JavaScript and has become increasingly popular. TypeScript offers strong typing and compile-time verification to our React applications. As a result, using TypeScript helps eliminate entire classes of bugs that commonly affect our apps.

When adopting new tech for development, we should always focus on the impact to the user. The user doesn‚Äôt care what tech we use unless it makes their user experience better (less friction, more delightful, etc.). Users definitely do not want a buggy experience, and of course, neither do we.

Hi, I‚Äôm Ben Ilegbodu üëãüèæ. In this minishop, you will learn how to use TypeScript to build React applications. But instead of simply covering types and syntax, the minishop will have a focus on how using TypeScript can prevent common bugs that infect our applications.

Maybe you‚Äôre concerned about the code health of your app and what to learn how **TypeScript can provide confidence** in making big changes. Or maybe your team is building a new React application and you want to see if **TypeScript makes sense** before kicking off the project. Or maybe you‚Äôre just questioning whether **TypeScript is worth the learning curve** when you‚Äôre already productive building React applications.

Whether these are your reasons or you have others, you‚Äôll no doubt leave convinced that TypeScript will help you in your current or future React projects.

## Get ready to...

- Learn basic TypeScript types and syntax
- Definite fully type-safe component props
- Type common React hooks
- Handle forms and other events
- Leverage generics to provide parameterized props
- ...and many more features that help you write quality code

## You‚Äôll need to have...

- No prior experience with TypeScript is necessary! üôåüèæ
- Attended the [Zero to React with Hooks](/minishops/zero-to-react-with-hooks/) minishop or have similar experience building React applications using hooks

## This minishop may not be for you if you...

- Already have some experience using TypeScript in React
- Don‚Äôt yet have experience using hooks in React (consider the [Migrating to React Hooks](/minishops/migrating-to-react-hooks/) minishop instead)

## What are ‚Äúminishops‚Äù?

Minishops by Ben Ilegbodu are fully-remote workshops that last about 3 hours. They're highly-focused, covering only the concepts you want to learn so that you can level up your skills and get on with the rest of your day. By keeping it short, you‚Äôre able to absorb and retain the information before fatigue sets in and other distractions get in your way.
