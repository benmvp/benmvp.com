## Hooray! You're all set! ðŸŽ‰

Check your email inbox. You should've received an email from **Eventbrite** containing your registration for the minishop. If you don't receive it within the next hour (and you've checked your Spam folder), reach out to [team@benmvp.com](mailto:team@benmvp.com).

The minishop will take place as a [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) meeting, so if you don't yet have the app, please download it ahead of time. You will receive an email a few days before the minishop takes place with the Zoom link, as well as further instructions for setting up prior to the minishop.

Looking forward to learning together!
