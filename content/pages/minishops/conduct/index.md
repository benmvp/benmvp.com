## The Quick Version

Our minishop is dedicated to providing a harassment-free minishop experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of minishop participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any minishop venue, including presentations, comments, questions, video chat, Twitter and other online media. minishop participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the minishop _**without a refund**_ at the discretion of the minishop organizers.

## The Less Quick Version

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the minishop organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the minishop _**with no refund**_.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of minishop staff immediately.

minishop staff will be happy to help participants contact venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the minishop. We value your attendance.

We expect participants to follow these rules at minishop and minishop venues and minishop-related social events.
