Ben Ilegbodu is a Jesus follower (aka a [Christian](http://www.aweandreverence.com/gospel/what-is-the-gospel/248)), a husband, and a father of 3. He lives in Pittsburg, California with his wife Rashida and their children Simone, Avery and Asher.

Ben joined [Stitch Fix](https://www.stitchfix.com/) ([@stitchfix](https://twitter.com/stitchfix)) in October 2019 as a Principal Frontend Engineer, tasked with building a new React-based Design System and helping to raise the level of frontend within the customer-facing organization.

Prior to Stitch Fix, he spent over 4 years at [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/) ([@eventbrite](https://twiter.com/eventbrite)) as a Principal Frontend Engineer and nearly 9 years at [Zazzle](http://www.zazzle.com) ([@Zazzle](https://twitter.com/zazzle)) as UI Architect.

Ben attended [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/) ([@stanford](http://twitter.com/stanford)) and received both a B.S. and M.S. in Computer Science with an HCI concentration. His strong computer science background, coupled with his HCI training and passion for building web sites, has provided him with a unique set of skills where he is able to get nitty gritty with hardcore back-end developers as well as work through challenging UX issues with designers and product managers.

Ben is passionate about building frontend systems. On the UI side that results in [React](https://reactjs.org/)-based component libraries, but he also spends a lot of time with frontend "divops" (Babel, Webpack, ESLint, packaging libraries, CI, etc.). He also loves teaching others in order to level up their JavaScript and React skills.
