## [Ask a question](https://github.com/benmvp/ama/issues/new) | [Read questions](https://github.com/benmvp/ama/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)

Anything means anything. Personal questions. Money. Life. Code. Whatever.

I can also be reached on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/benmvp) and [email](mailto:ben+ama@benmvp.com), but [asking here](https://github.com/benmvp/ama/issues/new) means anyone can read the answer!

- Use a succinct title and description
- Bugs & feature requests should be opened on the relevant issue tracker
- Support questions are better asked on [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/)
- Be civil and polite ðŸ˜€
