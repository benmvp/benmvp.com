        "Everything was great! I've seen hooks in our code a little but wanted something to really help my understanding of when to use them and how they work. The pace was great and a great mix of teaching and exercises to keep everyone engaged. I'll definitely be finishing up the bonus exercises and the final quiz over the next few weeks!",

        "There was a *lot* covered in this workshop! The one thing I was really glad to see is the format of the workshop. First we listened to you teach, heard the 'whys' of all the principles, then could practice, and if we didn't finish in time (or needed more visual cues), there were written solutions in addition to the written lessons in the repo. I also really enjoyed some of the smaller nuances in each lessons, like hearing the term 'lazy initialization', for useState optimization. The mention of localStorage and its use cases. The use 'dependency array' and 'memoization' when talking about useEffect. The term 'subscription' when talking about events (most documentation doesn't dig into what 'subscription' means). It's these small touches, and subtle explanations that help any developer that has been working in environments that don't prioritize mentorship make some really impactful breakthroughs in their learning path.",

        "Overall, this course was really useful! I definitely benefited from having a decent amount of experience with React Hooks, so thank you for making that knowledge a prerequisite and providing some resources to look at before the course. The repo is incredible, it's really awesome to have some preexisting code to work with. I 10/10 love the emojis and the goals within each of the parts. The hints are very clear and make the exercises flow really well. The breakout rooms were also a nice touch. The change from main room to breakout room helped shift me into exercise mode which made me more productive. The comment to the breakout room saying that the rooms would close in  few minutes was also very helpful.",

        'Excellent workshop.  Ben is a great teacher, well prepared and very knowledgeable. I used TypeScript before, but Ben fill up some gaps.  I am more comfortable with interfaces and the use of events and  hooks and typescript.  I would love to see a second class for advanced typescript with specific use of Generics in depth.  Thank you very much',

        "I liked how you structured each lesson so we could see before/after in the repo. That's really helpful for the exercise portion, especially when we get stuck, and for self-directed learning later. Tying it to README instructions which we could also follow on GitHub was awesome as well. I also appreciated when you weren't sure about something or when you mentioned you learned something new; it's helpful for students sometimes to see when the teacher may not have all the answers. It may have been helpful to have more time for the group exercises, but understand the tradeoff with wanting to cover a lot of material in the session. Nice work and thank you!",

Your notes are very helpful and encouraging, and the layout of everything makes it easier to go back to in a week or two and really dive in again solo.  Thank you for putting so much time into this and sharing with us!! :-) Your teaching style and delivery are really calm and informative, and very approachable.  Thanks!!",
