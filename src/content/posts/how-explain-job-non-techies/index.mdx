Keep learning my friends. ðŸ¤“

- Got into web development because I liked seeing visual output
  - Liked being able to send my mom a URL and say "I built this"
- Things were simpler when I got my first paid job to build websites
  - Rice University CMC department of ECE
  - I was literally building their website
- Over time it's gotten more difficult to explain as I've moved further behind the scenes in platform work
- Wife knows what I do but simultaneously doesn't
  - So when I try to explain what's going on at work, her eyes glaze over at technical jargon
  - Things just aren't as tangible
- Found that the best way to explain is with analogies
- She's an interior designer, so I use examples from her world
  - Architecture: design consultant
  - Design system: furniture
  - DivOps - painting a room
  - Pairing - apprenticeship
  - Code review - city inspector?
