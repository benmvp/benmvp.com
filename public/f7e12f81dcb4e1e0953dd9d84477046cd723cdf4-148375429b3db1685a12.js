But even with all of the \\\"magic\\\" that React provides, it's still easy to write suboptimal React code.\\n\\nEventbrite recently transitioned from a Backbone/Marionette stack over to a React-based one. We developed many React best practices from the very beginning to provide code consistency and prevent immediate technical debt from poorly written code. In this session geared towards developers already familiar with React, let's walk through the guidelines and rules Eventbrite adopted so we can apply them to our own teams and projects.\"},\"es6\":{\"title\":\"Sugar & Spice and everything nice about ES6\",\"categories\":[\"javascript\"],\"retired\":true,\"description\":\"ECMAScript 6 is the new version of JavaScript making its way into the engines of our modern browsers and servers. Some of its features appear to be no more than a little syntax sugar — making development we already do in JavaScript a bit easier. Others add brand new functionality long missing in JavaScript, which allow us to spice up our code without having to include yet another library.\\n\\nExperience with JavaScript will help you get the most out of this session, but you don't have to be a JS ninja to leave confident to begin using ES6 right now. Let's walk through all the sugar and spice of ES6 and what makes it just so nice for code readability. Along the way, you'll learn about arrow functions, destructuring, rest parameters, and other features. We'll also see strategies for how we can circumvent that pesky issue of cross-browser compatibility. Oh, and don't worry if you didn't understand any of those terms — you will after the session.\"},\"sweet-es6\":{\"title\":\"Sweet ES6\",\"categories\":[\"javascript\"],\"retired\":true,\"description\":\"ECMAScript 6 is the new version of JavaScript and is already available in the engines of our modern browsers and servers. Many of its features are just a little syntactic sugar to help make our JavaScript code clearer and more concise.

Oh, and don't worry if you didn't understand any of those terms — you soon will after this session.\"},\"typescript-react\":{\"title\":\"TypeScript + React = ❤️\",\"categories\":[\"react\",\"typescript\"],\"description\":\"TypeScript is a JavaScript superset that compiles down to vanilla JavaScript and has become increasingly popular. TypeScript proponents proclaim that it eliminates entire classes of bugs that affect our applications. But what exactly are those bugs? Which ones are particular to building React components and applications? Is TypeScript worth the learning curve?\\n\\nIn this session geared towards devs with prior experience building React applications, let’s answer those questions. We’ll walk through the common bugs that infect our apps and learn how the use of strong types with TypeScript can help prevent them. After the session, you’ll be itching to try it out in your next project!\"},\"why-react\":{\"title\":\"Why choose React?\",\"categories\":[\"react\",\"javascript\"],\"retired\":true,\"description\":\"As the Frontend Platform team at Eventbrite switched from Backbone/Marionette over to React, it had to convince other developers, managers, directors, and non-engineers that React was the right path. And the rationale for moving wasn't just because React is insanely popular. There are many tangible benefits that make the effort of migrating worthwhile.\\n\\nNew to React and want to learn a little about how it works? Seeking ammunition to convince your team to make the change? Come learn about _why_ we made the decision to transition to React, through an introduction of _how_ to build user interactions with React.\"},\"web-apis\":{\"title\":\"Wait... the Web can do what?1?!\",\"categories\":[\"web\"],\"description\":\"ES.next, React, CSS Grid, Service Workers and other new technologies are getting all the attention within the frontend community. They enable us to easily build sophisticated UIs across all devices. But there are even more, lesser-known Web APIs that help us further blur the lines between browser and native apps!\\n\\nIn this session geared towards frontend engineers of all skill levels, let's learn about some Web APIs that you may have never heard of before! We'll look at audio, video, interaction, and device diagnostic APIs — where they are supported and how you can apply them in your next project.\"},\"no-js\":{\"title\":\"You don't need JavaScript for that!\",\"categories\":[\"css\"],\"retired\":true,\"description\":\"We have been using JavaScript toolkits like jQuery for nearly a decade to make manipulating the DOM easier as we create our highly-interactive web apps. New features in HTML5 & CSS3 should've made old development strategies obsolete, and yet we're still using jQuery to do things better suited for HTML5 & CSS3. Why? Well, old habits die hard.\\n\\nIn this session, let's look at ways we used to build interactivity in JavaScript and see how we can transform them into more optimal solutions using plain old HTML and CSS. We'll discuss CSS3 transitions & animations, new HTML5 attributes, and other \\\"tricks\\\" to offload JavaScript functionality to the browser's rendering engine for more performant web applications. Whether you're a seasoned JavaScripter or just getting started, you'll leave the session with fresh ideas to work with.\"},\"nextjs-rendering\":{\"title\":\"50 shades of React rendering with Next.js\",\"categories\":[\"javascript\",\"react\",\"nextjs\",\"web\"],\"description\":\"CSR. SSG. SSR. ISR. These acronyms may seem similar, but they represent different rendering methods for React applications. In the past, we had to commit to a single rendering approach for the entire app, but with Next.js, we have the flexibility to choose the optimal rendering type for each page. This hybrid approach aligns closely with the unique needs of our applications. Imagine a landing page with static content that updates only when the code changes, a universally consistent page that undergoes frequent changes, and a personalized logged-in page with content tailored to each user—all rendered differently within a single application.\\n\\nThis session is designed for React developers of all backgrounds. We'll explore the various types of rendering methods and deep dive into how Next.js empowers us to leverage them effectively. By the end of this talk, you'll not only gain a comprehensive understanding of these different rendering methods but also have the confidence to make informed decisions that maximize the potential of your React applications.\"},\"divops\":{\"title\":\"\\\"DivOps\\\" Engineering: Unveiling the fusion of Frontend and DevOps\",\"categories\":[\"divops\",\"javascript\",\"web\"],\"description\":\"As web application architecture continues to evolve, the role of frontend engineers has expanded beyond `src/`. The need to enhance the developer experience and ensure project health has given rise to a new era of responsibilities for frontend developers. While these tasks may not involve building UI features directly, they encompass critical areas such as app configurations, build scripts, CI/CD maintenance, and more. But what should we call this disciple? Is it Frontend Platform? Frontend Infra? Frontend... DevOps?\\n\\nThis session introduces \\\"DivOps,\\\" the fusion of Frontend and DevOps. Designed for web app developers of all levels, this talk deep dives into all the responsibilities of DivOps engineering and its major impact on our development environments, testing procedures, CI/CD workflows, and beyond. Through real-world examples and insights, you will gain a deeper understanding of the qualities that make a successful DivOps engineer and realize that you're likely one too.\"}}");
