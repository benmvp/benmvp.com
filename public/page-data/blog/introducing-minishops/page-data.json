Up until this point, it‚Äôs come in the form of mentoring and pairing at work and <a href=\"/speak/\">speaking at conferences</a> publicly.</p>\n<p>Well, this global pandemic that‚Äôs forcing most of us to shelter-in-place has canceled all of my conference speaking for the foreseeable future. This has opened up the time that I normally devoted to prepping for talks. I‚Äôve used some of that time to return to <a href=\"/blog/\">blogging</a>, but the majority I‚Äôve put into transforming my in-person workshops into remote workshops.</p>\n<p>I call these remote workshops <a href=\"/minishops/\"><strong>‚Äúminishops‚Äù</strong></a> because they are short (aka ‚Äúmini‚Äù) workshops. These minishops will last only about 3 hours so that they can be very focused on just a couple of topics instead of covering many different topics to fill a whole day workshop.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Full-day or multi-day workshops work for many people (myself included), but they do not work for everyone. My goal is to provide another style of workshop that hopefully will be better suited for a different group of learners.</p>\n<h2 id=\"learning\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#learning\" aria-label=\"learning permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Learning</h2>\n<p>Some people cannot absorb too much at a given time, especially when the topic is new. So the last few hours of a full-day workshop aren‚Äôt retained well. Similarly, some folks simply need time to pass for what they‚Äôve learned to sink in and stick before going on to learn more.</p>\n<h2 id=\"pacing\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#pacing\" aria-label=\"pacing permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Pacing</h2>\n<p>I‚Äôve also found that it‚Äôs hard to have pacing that works for everyone in the longer workshops. As I mentioned, those that are new can get lost towards the end of a long workshop, which is right when those with some experience are finally getting engaged. In the beginning, those ‚Äúexperienced‚Äù learners are typically bored because they already know the introductory material. Both sides do learn so it‚Äôs certainly not a bad experience by any means. But for those attendees in these situations, it is suboptimal.</p>\n<p>That‚Äôs why in my minishops I‚Äôm including a <strong>‚ÄúThis minishop may not be for you‚Äù</strong> section to ensure that ‚Äútoo skilled‚Äù learners don‚Äôt attend minishops for topics they already know. There are other minishops where they can be newbies instead. üòÑ</p>\n<h2 id=\"timing\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#timing\" aria-label=\"timing permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Timing</h2>\n<p>Lastly, there are some people who simply can‚Äôt spend the whole day at a workshop. A remote workshop is convenient because we don‚Äôt have to travel to a single location to learn, but it can be hard to focus and avoid getting distracted for a full day.</p>\n<p>It‚Äôs my hope is that with the minishop only being 3 hours, attendees will still be able to attend meetings or get some work done before or after the minishop if they need to.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>I‚Äôve got about 10 minishops in mind, but I‚Äôm not releasing them all at once. I‚Äôm starting off with these three:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/minishops/migrating-to-react-hooks/\">Migrating to React Hooks</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/minishops/typescript-for-react-developers/\">TypeScript for React Developers</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/minishops/zero-to-react-with-hooks/\">Zero to React with Hooks</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>I want to see if these minishops are something that stick and I should continue pursuing. I spent the last month or so <a href=\"/blog/new-gatsby-site/\">redesigning my site</a> in part to enable these minishops, so I‚Äôm hoping that it all works out well.</p>\n<p>As of right now, I‚Äôm still finalizing the dates and costs of these minishops. If you have a minishop you‚Äôd like to attend, feel free to fill out the form at the bottom of that minishop‚Äôs page and I‚Äôll notify you when it is scheduled next.</p>\n<p>Some other minishop ideas to pique your interest:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Patterns for Sharing Component Logic in React</strong> - Render props, HOCs, custom hooks, etc.</li>\n<li><strong>Real-world React</strong> - all the other things that come after an intro to React course</li>\n<li><strong>Styling in React</strong> - css modules, css-in-js, tailwind css, etc.</li>\n<li><strong>React component libraries</strong> - creating an internal or external component library</li>\n<li><strong>Frontend Divops</strong> - webpack, babel, jest, linting, prettier, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Keep learning my friends. ü§ì</p>","excerpt":"If you haven‚Äôt realized yet, I enjoy teaching.
